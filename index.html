                    <h2 class="details-title">Overview</h2>
                    <p class="details-text">This is a third-person shooter survival game completed during an apprenticeship for Prosper IT Consulting
                    where I participated in Agile/Scrum practices by completing user stories to deliver a functional MVP game in Unreal Engine version 5.3.
                    This turned out to be an amazing proof of concept that I will likely continue
                    learning and iterating on in the future. It was aimed at a target audience of former Call of Duty Zombie players where
                    we saw play sessions exceeding 5 hours on twitch. I was fully responsible for every aspect of the game's development including concept,
                    planning, design, animation, and programming. Nearly every feature/mechanic included had to be referenced from Unreal's documentation, forums, or tutorial guides 
                    as this was my first game in Unreal Engine. The project is nowhere near perfect and many times I just needed to get something working to move forward. 
                    Completing this game, however, taught me
                    better development skills which I will continue building upon.

                <p class="details-text">&emsp;At first I designed a scenario where there would be spawns that move into positions each wave to “set-up”. Similar to
                vehicles moving around the parameter and “parking.” This might be beneficial in the future but would have required too
                much effort for a concept I first needed to prove.
                <br><br>&emsp;I simplified the system by having static spawns around the map
                that would randomly “activate” for the wave. Iterating through play testing I added <span style="color: #00acee;">directional sounds</span>,
                <span style="color: #00acee;">particle effects</span>, and <span style="color: #00acee;">glowing material</span> to the spawns to help telegraph to the player where the enemies would be coming from.

                    &emsp;I designed a map for the player that took into account open areas, narrow paths, and item locations.

                        <li>Identified main traffic areas for the player and placed spawns that intercepted them.

                        <li>Placed item interactables in locations depending on interaction frequency. For example, ammo and health are going to be bought more
                        frequently than revive or weapon upgrades. Therefore they should be where the player will spend most of 
                        their time, while also have the risk of being between enemy spawns

                    &emsp;I began with outlining wave-specific goals I wanted the player to experience. Specifically:
                    <ul class="game-statistics2">
                        <li>Wave 3 - First Purchase

                        <li>Wave 4 - Second Purchase

                        <li>Wave 5 - Third Purchase
                        </li>
                        <li>All Purchases Complete Before 10
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="details-text">
                    &emsp;With these in mind, I tailored the gameplay experience. Through hours of playtesting and iteration I determined exactly
                    how many enemies to spawn, focusing on their health, speed, and spawn rate for each wave. Often, initially doubling the
                    number so the player could instantly see the increase without any discrepancies.
                </p>

                <p class="details-text">
                    &emsp;After clearly defining the amount of enemies along with their health, it became 
                    much simplier to calculate the minimum amount of points (killing enemies without 
                    headshots) the player will have after each 
                    wave. This gave a baseline to price buyable objects to meet the wave-specific goals. Notice above 
                    how a price of 2500 seemed fitting for the first item since the minimum amount of points gathered would be 2660. By making all buyables initially 2500, the player
                    then has meaningful choices to make. Also, if the player prioritizes heashots and doesn't buy as much health,
                    they will be rewarded by getting upgrades faster and thus making survival easier.

                    <li>Added a movement speed buyable to expand player choices alongside weapon and health upgrades.
                    </li>
                    <li>Revised map boundaries to remove invisible barriers
                    </li>
                    <li>Adjusted starting ammo to ensure the player wouldn't enter a state where they buy health and can't afford
                        ammo with an empty weapon. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Capped maximum active spawns to 6 so the player would always have options to navigate, balancing difficulty
                    </li>
                    <li>Balanced price of revive to ensure player could always buy the max amount before 10. It initially 
                        cost more skulls than could be obtained. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Tuned enemy health on wave 7 to only increase by 25 to align with shorter time-to-kill that 
                        helped players acclimate to the max speed increase.

                    add variability depending on if the player was aiming or hip firing. Then, it would check the surface material hit to

                    &emsp;Since I initially had the start position of the line trace at the muzzle of the gun, there would be many situations
                    where traces towards closer objects would hit without the crosshairs being over it. This wasn't telegraphed well to the
                    player and I personally found it frustrating when missing enemies because they were too close to me. To fix this I
                    <span style="color: #00acee;">calculated the center point of the screen</span> and projected it to world space for the start position. With that, the trace
                    would always hit what the crosshair was hovered over, eliminating any discrepancies.

                &emsp;The way I called the animation function worked but if I had to do it again I would try having all the logic on the

                need to change the animation playrate. Currently, I have to change both the playrate and the

                activate at the same time. Through debugging and researching online, I found out that Unreal Engine’s node macro
                iterates through all elements of an array and then outputs. This was a problem if I wanted to add a delay with sound and
                particle effects after each element so that the player would have proper time to prepare. To achieve this functionality,
                I implemented a branch with a counter set to the size of the array holding the spawns to activate.

                        <li>I was able to quickly adapt to Unreal Engine concepts, successfully self-teaching
                        every feature implemented in the project.
                        </li>
                        <li>Refactoring features like the interactable system using blueprint interfaces
                            went extremely smooth and solidified my understanding through repetition. </li>
                        <li> The initial design was precise enough to meet the intended player experience through gameplay iteration.
                        </li>
                        <li>Delivered a minimum viable product with replayable proof of concept in 2 weeks.</li>
                        <li>Onboarding process into Prosper IT Consulting development team went flawlessly with no slow 
                            downs and meeting all Agile/Scrum expectations.</li>
                        <li>Received well among target audience resulting in play sessions exceeding 5 hours on twitch. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This project was done right as Unreal Engine migrated everything to fab and it couldn't have been
                            more of a mess. I'm hopeful the kinks will get straightened out in the future but I experienced
                        many bugs, loss of content that was originally in my marketplace, numerous crashes, and lag. Couple hours
                        of development time lost.</li>
                        <li>Committing changes went well at the beginning but started getting stashed changes on the master branch
                            that I had to discard every commit. </li>
                        <li>Wasted too much time trying to find the "best way" of implenting some features early on.  </li>

                    <h4>What I learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Save more often, Unreal Engine crashes. Especially when using Fab.</li>
                        <li>Look things up faster when I don't know something, be less stubborn in trying to figure it out myself.</li>
                        <li>Test more frequently. Every small change should be tested before moving onto another.</li>
                        <li>To have better naming conventions. Things start to get out of hand pretty qucikly when importing multiple assets
                            from online repositories. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Get something working first before worrying about its efficiency. Development time was lost caring too much about
                        "the best way" of doing something when I should have just got something working first.
                        </li>
                        <li>Comment more. I found myself wanting more comments when going back to something I worked on a few days earlier. It
                            would have been helpful to get me back into that heahspace again. 
                        </li>
                        <li>If importing more than one asset at a time from Fab, it is better to import it to a blank project and migrate the asset to your
                        working environment.</li>
                        <li>Close out of Fab and restart Unreal Engine after importing.</li>
                        <li>Better communication methods like blueprint interfaces. I was able to go back through all interactable objects and
                        decouple casting references. Moving forward I will be able to further improve upon this by using a combination of event dispathers. </li>
                        <li>Don't have Unreal Engine open while you are commiting/pushing code to the repository. </li>

                    micro-game on time. I personally was tasked with creating a Space Invaders clone that would play in an arcade machine. I
                    encountered numerous mechanics and features needing to be implemented that I knew nothing about. Not only did I
                    successfully learn new material and deliver a completed product 3 days ahead of schedule, but I gained hands-on project
                    management and team programming skills that will be used and built upon in future projects.

                    I did a simple check to see if the player was within those two values. If they were, then allow input to move the

                    movement to see if the player was outside the bounds. If they were outside the bounds, (which would mean they can never

                    the player position is valid) would return true, allowing the player to move again.

                    &emsp;When I created the prefab for this projectile and added the physics 
                    layer and object tag, I saw all pre-existing physics 
                    layers in the project. After reading the project documentation, I realized the 
                    necessity for <span style="color: #FFD700;">additional physics layers to be added to the project</span> so that the 
                    Space Invaders 
                    clone could behave in the same manner as its original. To be clear, this was
                    before adding any enemies or shields into the game. I saw ahead of time that 
                    I would be detecting/ignoring collisions differently than what the current 
                    settings of the project allotted for. Specifically, I needed:
                    <ul class="game-statistics2">
                        <li>the player projectile to collide with the enemy projectile and the enemy

                        <li>the player projectile to ignore the player and the shield (allowing the player to strategically be positioned
                        behind the shield and shoot through it)
                        </li>
                        <li>enemy projectile to collide with the shield, player projectile, and player
                        </li>
                        <li>the enemy projectile to ignore the other enemies</li>

                    &emsp;At this point in development, I <span style="color: #FFD700;">reached out to the project manager</span> communicating the need for these additions to the
                    project. Since I did this as soon as I noticed the need, <span style="color: #FFD700;">proper additions were made to the project’s collision matrix</span>
                    resulting in zero slow downs to other developers or merge conflicts. In fact, when I started working on
                    the Environment / Enemy stories a couple days later, I was able to start and complete my deliverables without any delay.
                    If I had said nothing and just waited until I encountered that problem within the story, I would have been at a

                        &emsp;Through thorough playtesting later in development, I discovered a crash that would occur with the wave script when the
                        player attempted to play again. I came back to this script to debug it and found a situation that could occur where
                        <span style="color: red;">enemies are added to the list that's not empty</span>. This scenario specifically occurs when a player dies in a previous game
                        and launches another. All the enemies from the previous game stay in the list and the new game enemies are added to it.
                        Then when the wave script moves the enemies, it <span style="color: red;">crashes because it's attempting to move enemies that no longer
                        exist</span>.

                    Developed and submitted a micro game as a final assignment for The Tech Academy, meeting both the requirements of a win
                    condition and C#
                    scripting. This was a rapid exercise meant to get a concept implemented as fast as possible.
                    I applied fundamental Unity principles of sprites, 2D collisions, player input, and game management to
                    transform a basic
                    concept into a functional and engaging experience.

                    This project marked my first interaction with C++ coding in Unreal Engine where I explored Unreal's naming
                    conventions and the benefits it has over Blueprints. I coded custom character classes and actors that included only the
                    necessary variables and Paper2D components.

                I am still currently building this portfolio site and this summary is in the process of being migrated from
                an older repository. I am pushing live updates
                daily but any specific quesitons please ask me. I'd be more than happy to jump on a call and screen share
                anything in the meantime.
