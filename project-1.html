                        <p class="details-text">This is a third-person shooter survival game completed during an
                            apprenticeship for Prosper IT Consulting
                            where I participated in Agile/Scrum practices by completing user stories to deliver a functional
                            MVP game in Unreal Engine version 5.3.
                            This turned out to be an amazing proof of concept that I will likely continue
                            learning and iterating on in the future. It was aimed at a target audience of former Call of
                            Duty Zombie players where
                            we saw play sessions exceeding 5 hours on twitch. I was fully responsible for every aspect of
                            the game's development including concept,
                            planning, design, animation, and programming. Nearly every feature/mechanic included had to be
                            referenced from Unreal's documentation, forums, or tutorial guides
                            as this was my first game in Unreal Engine. The project is nowhere near perfect and many times I
                            just needed to get something working to move forward.
                            Completing this game, however, taught me
                            better development skills which I will continue building upon.

                            Create as many of those situations as possible.

                            Player should experience the quick ability to die or redscreen. Adding intrinsic meaning to
                            surviving.

                            on where the enemies are coming from.

                        <li>Account for <span style="color: red;">gameplay mastery</span>. Include progressive scaling for
                            waves so when
                            the player masters the movement, pathing, and enemy attack patterns, they can continue past wave
                            10 until death in attempt to survive high waves.

                            buyable objects and upgrades. Player can choose between doing more damage, moving faster, or

                        and killing them so I wanted to innovate on difficulty parameters while also creating as many close

                        <p class="details-text">&emsp;At first I designed a scenario where there would be spawns that move
                            into positions each wave to “set-up”. Similar to
                            vehicles moving around the parameter and “parking.” This might be beneficial in the future but
                            would have required too
                            much effort for a concept I first needed to prove.
                            <br><br>&emsp;I simplified the system by having static spawns around the map
                            that would randomly “activate” for the wave. Iterating through play testing I added <span
                                style="color: #00acee;">directional sounds</span>,
                            <span style="color: #00acee;">particle effects</span>, and <span style="color: #00acee;">glowing
                                material</span> to the spawns to help telegraph to the player where the enemies would be
                            coming from.

                            &emsp;I designed a map for the player that took into account open areas, narrow paths, and item

                        <ul class="game-statistics2">

                            <li>All Purchases Complete Before 10

                            how many enemies to spawn, focusing on their health, speed, and spawn rate for each wave. Often,
                            initially doubling the
                            number so the player could instantly see the increase without any discrepancies.

                            much simplier to calculate the minimum amount of points (killing enemies without
                            headshots) the player will have after each
                            wave. This gave a baseline to price buyable objects to meet the wave-specific goals. Notice
                            above
                            how a price of 2500 seemed fitting for the first item since the minimum amount of points
                            gathered would be 2660. By making all buyables initially 2500, the player
                            then has meaningful choices to make. Also, if the player prioritizes heashots and doesn't buy as
                            much health,
                            they will be rewarded by getting upgrades faster and thus making survival easier.

                            &emsp;Since I initially had the start position of the line trace at the muzzle of the gun, there
                            would be many situations
                            where traces towards closer objects would hit without the crosshairs being over it. This wasn't

                            there were certain edge cases initially where they player would lose more ammo than intended.
                            This was solved by always

                            All variables regarding ammo can be changed and this still functions properly.

                        only
                        need to change the animation playrate. Currently, I have to change both the playrate and the

                        rapid changing to variables during iterative play testing, I built a function that
                        would switch the wave number and set all difficulty parameters. This allowed for Individual
                        tweaks to difficulty while also setting a linear progression after wave 7.

                        I wrote spawn logic that would be called at the start of each new wave, and check to see
                        if more enemies needed to be spawned after one died. To do this I kept track of the total
                        amount of enemies in the wave as well as the total amount to spawn in at one time. Then
                        to increase the difficulty I promoted the delay between each spawn into a variable that is
                        modified in the wave logic.

                        &emsp; I ran into significant issues trying to implement a delay using a for loop. When a wave
                        started, all spawns would
                        activate at the same time. Through debugging and researching online, I found out that Unreal
                        Engine’s node macro
                        iterates through all elements of an array and then outputs. This was a problem if I wanted to add a
                        delay with sound and
                        particle effects after each element so that the player would have proper time to prepare. To achieve
                        this functionality,
                        I implemented a branch with a counter set to the size of the array holding the spawns to activate.

                            <li>Look things up faster when I don't know something, be less stubborn in trying to figure it

                            <li>To have better naming conventions. Things start to get out of hand pretty qucikly when
                                importing multiple assets
                                from online repositories.

                            <li>Get something working first before worrying about its efficiency. Development time was lost
                                caring too much about
                                "the best way" of doing something when I should have just got something working first.
                            </li>
                            <li>Comment more. I found myself wanting more comments when going back to something I worked on
                                a few days earlier. It
                                would have been helpful to get me back into that heahspace again.
                            </li>
                            <li>If importing more than one asset at a time from Fab, it is better to import it to a blank
                                project and migrate the asset to your
                                working environment.</li>
                            <li>Close out of Fab and restart Unreal Engine after importing.</li>
                            <li>Better communication methods like blueprint interfaces. I was able to go back through all
                                interactable objects and
                                decouple casting references. Moving forward I will be able to further improve upon this by
                                using a combination of event dispathers. </li>
